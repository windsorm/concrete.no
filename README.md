Second semester exam project at Zealand Academy | Multimedia Design. 

We are creating a digital solution incl. website, SoMe plan, visual identity and online marketing plan for a young project that creates concrete and gypsum decorations mostly for flower pots. It started in midst of covid lockdown, therefore it is a opportunity for us to help to build the brand and digital appearance for it to go international.
